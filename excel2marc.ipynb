Many accidents have taken place due to failure of formwork and scaffolding on various construction sites. The book entitled\"Formwork for Civil Engineering Construction Works\"is an attempt to stress the need for proper planning, safe design and construction practices of formwork, shoring, underpinning and scaffoldings used in construction industry. This is the first book in its category in India which is meant to educate comprehensively the civil  engineering students as well as practicing engineers about latest materials, design procedures and methods of erection for formwork and scaffolding under different conditions. Slip form technology is a new innovation in this field and it has been covered in detail in chapter-6 of the book. A large number of figures and photographs make the book easily conceivable to the learners.\n",

Chapters 3 to 18 represent the UML language, the building blocks of UML i.e., things, relationships and diagrams and the use of each diagram with an example. Chapters 19 and 20 discuss a case study \"Library Management System\". In this case study one can get a very clear idea what object oriented analysis and design is and how UML is to be used for that purpose. Appendix-A discusses the different syntactic notations of UML and Appendix-B discusses how the three approaches of Booch, Rum Baugh and Jacobson are unified and about the Unified Process.\n",

      "This volume is one of the two which offer a comprehensive course in those parts of theory and practice of Plane and Geodetic surveying that are most commonly used by Civil Engineers. The first volume covers in 24 chapters, the most common surveying operations. Each topic introduced is thoroughly described, the theory is rigorously developed, and a large number of numerical examples are included to illustrate its application. General statements of important principles and methods are almost invariably given by practical illustration. Apart from illustrations of old and conventional instruments, emphasis has been placed on new or modern instruments, both for ordinary as well as precise work. A good deal of space has been given to instrumental adjustments with thorough discussion of geometrical principles in each case. Many new advanced problems have also been added which will prove useful for competitive examinations.\n",
